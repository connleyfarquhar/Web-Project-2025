        <h2>1987-1993</h2>
        <p>
          It all started during the year 1987 whilst enrolled in Lycée Carnot a secondary school of education in Paris, France. 
          They both then became great friends through a shared interest in the film and music industry and would since create various demo songs and shortfilms together.
          This then allowed the group called Darlin' to form in 1992 with the members that consist of Laurent Brancowitz, Bangalter and de Homem-Chriso.
          <br>
          <br>
          The group decided on the name Darlin' after a song by the Beach Boys which is also the same name. Through this band they created a few songs but one of their most recognisable ones was called Cindy So Loud. 
          Through these songs they managed to work with a label called Duophonic Records EP and since invited the trio to play at shows across the United Kingdom. A Bad review on the band labelled the genre as "daft punky thrash" 
          and then Darlin' was disbanded to form the infamous Daft Punk leaving Brancowitz to move on to other efforts.

        <h2>1993-1998</h2>
        <p>
          During 1993, Bangalter and de Homem-Christo turned up to a party at EuroDisney where they met Stuart Macmillan who was a co-founder of Soma Quality Recordings. They had given Stuart a demo that the duo have worked on
          This demo turned into their single called "The New Wave" that was then renamed and released as Alive and has since became their very first Album.
          <br>
          <br>
          Skipping a few years, the year is now 1995 and Daft Punk came to the studio to record "Da Funk". This became their first ever successful single the same year it released. Through the success of Da Funk the duo
          were looking for a Manager to which they found a great fit rather quickly, a guy called Pedro Winter. Pedro then went on to promote the duo at various night clubs and events which then caught the attention of Virgin Records and The Duo signed with them around September of 1996.
          They made a deal to license their music through their own company called Daft Lite (Also Known As Daft Trax or Daft Music).
